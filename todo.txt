	fix get torrent function to work properly with hdtv and 720p queries.//done
	most problems come because 720p shouldnt fallback to a broader search.
	or make a design choice and make 2 functions.
	try to make a nodewebkit build compatible with ac3 sound. it's neccesary if i want to stream 720p content.// later, much later

player
	fix bug where if we go back, it gives random error. no idea where to start because it is completely random// fixed by catching uncaughtErrors. It might crash everything if there are too many...but hell...

showslist
	pretty happy with this controller
	change view to give more data. like current week being shown, last date each showed aired, etc. according to site design.
